Sports Analysr is a showcase of projects/case studies related to analytics in Sports. The group consists of academics from various disciplines, Sports Science graduates and undergraduates of University of Sri Jayewardenepura. This is the first research group dedicated to sports analytics in Sri Lanka. Sports related problems are mainly analyzed using R programming, hence, "Sports AnalysR" 

Statistics in Sports is a growing field in Statistics, specially in North America, that provides specialized methodology for collecting and analyzing sports data in order to make decisions for successful planning and implementation of new strategies. Prior to the twenty-first century, decision making in sports was primarily based on the information acquired by observation. This has changed with technological advances, mainly related to data acquisition and the availability of personal computing.

The term “sports analytics” has been more popular than the term, “Statistics in sports”, perhaps due to the fact that the expertise is borrowed from different fields such as Statistics, Computer Science, Management, and the Health Sciences. Therefore, sports analytics is broadly described as the process of data management, predictive model implementation, and the use of information systems for decision making to gain a competitive advantage on the field of play (Alamar and Mehrotra 2011). There are many areas where sports analytics have been implemented. For example, sports teams use statistical analysis to evaluate players in order to determine the best game strategy. Sports associations develop rankings of players and teams, evaluate existing rules and study the feasibility of introducing new rules. Sports health professionals use statistical methods to understand players’ physical and mental conditions.
